We look at the structure of the reversed matrices. We find that the reversed matrices can be obtained by following operations -
​
1. Transpose the matrix - all rows to columns and columns to rows. This can be done by swapping all matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i] for all i<j.
​
2. Reverse each row of the matrix.
